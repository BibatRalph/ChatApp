TUTORIAL

Create an Account first 

You can put an avatar just click (add profile picture)

Wait for a bit signing up may take a while 

in Dashboard 

here is a search for user 

but you need to enter exactly the right username for them to show

Sample Users (these users are inside my database)

"mika"
"try2"

or you can create another account
and search your own user

Then start Chating
